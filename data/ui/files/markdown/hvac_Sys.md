# Modeling HVAC Systems

HVAC Systems are one of the most widely modeled systems in the built environment. This does not mean they are modeled in a similar way, even if the same standard was used. This can even be true when the same organization is responsible for the configuration of both models. It is this common truth that leads us to prescribe the methods and use of available modeling standards.

Below you will find representative examples of HVAC entities and the contained data definitions. These examples are not meant to prescribe exactly how you should model every AHU, but rather the methods and strategies for the most common HVAC entities you will encounter.

    This site does not represent the complete library of examples since 
    many examples are on the entities themselves. Check back 
    frequently for updates as we will be adding to these examples 
    several times throughout the year.
